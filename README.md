# CRT-Filter
## Description:
This is a filter that attempts to replicate the look of an old CRT TV with a slot mask.

## A little bit about how CRTs work:
A CRT (cathode ray tube) generates an image by using an electron gun to fire a beam of electrons at the back of a a glass "tube" . When the electrons hit a phosphor coating on the inside of the glass tube, they cause the phosphor to glow at a luminance relative to the intensity of the electron beam. To produce a color image three electron guns are fired, each individually producing an intensity equal to the luminance of the red green and blue input signal, and each are aligned to fire at specific phosphor dots which individually glow red green or blue. In order to separate the flying electrons and keep them from blending together, a "shadow mask" is typically used. The shadow mask consists of very tiny holes that are in ae pattern that alignes with the red, green and blue phosphor dots, resulting in the phosphors being hit by their corresponding electrons. These electron guns fire a beam in a horizontal sweeping pattern (left to right) across the screen at varying intensities, generating a single line of an image. They then turn off and move back to the left part of the screen just below the last line. This process is repeated at an incredibly fast rate until the entire image (one frame) is drawn. This process is repeated 60 times a second to produce the illusion of a solid and/or moving image.
